# AJAX Gmail-like Project

![Ruby v2.7.4](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?logo=ruby&label=Ruby&message=v2.7.4&color=0B0D0E&style=for-the-badge&labelColor=CC342D)
![Rails v5.2.3](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?logo=rubyonrails&label=Rails&message=v5.2.3&color=0B0D0E&style=for-the-badge&labelColor=cc0000)

During this project, I have created a fake ***Email Inbox Viewer*** web application.  

It offers less features than Gmail, but it uses AJAX and Ruby on Rails so it's a really cool project! :wink:  
The goal was not to create a new interface to receive our real emails on, but to learn and practice AJAX requests on a Rails 5 app.
